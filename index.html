        Hi, I'm David Carre√±o, originally from Venezuela but currently living in
        S√£o Paulo, Brazil. I have a passion for coding and enjoy developing web
        applications in my free time. I also love spending quality time with
        family and friends, and I enjoy playing football. Currently, I'm
        studying Software Development at BYU Idaho.

      <p>
        S√£o Paulo, Brazil, is a vibrant and dynamic city, known as the country's
        financial and cultural hub. It's characterized by its bustling economy,
        diverse population, and rich cultural scene, but also faces challenges
        like traffic congestion, social inequality, and environmental issues.
        The city is a blend of modern skyscrapers, historic architecture, and
        vast urban sprawl, making it a key player in Brazil's growth and a
        reflection of its complexities.
